        <h2>About Computer Basics</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Computer Basics, your one-stop destination for learning about computers. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, we've got you covered!</p>
        <p>In this website, you'll find information about the basic components of a computer, as well as essential troubleshooting techniques to help you overcome common issues.</p>

        <h2>Basic Components of a Computer</h2>
        <p>A computer consists of several key components that work together to perform various tasks. Here are the essential components:</p>
        <h3>1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
        <p>The CPU is often referred to as the brain of the computer. It executes instructions and performs calculations necessary for the computer to function.</p>
        <h3>2. Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
        <p>RAM is temporary storage that the computer uses to store data that is actively being used or processed. It allows for quick access to information, but the data is lost when the computer is powered off.</p>
        <h3>3. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or Solid State Drive (SSD)</h3>
        <p>The HDD or SSD is where the computer stores permanent data, including the operating system, applications, and user files. HDDs use spinning disks to store data, while SSDs use flash memory, providing faster access speeds.</p>
        <h3>4. Motherboard</h3>
        <p>The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer. It provides connections for other components and allows them to communicate with each other.</p>
        <h3>5. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h3>
        <p>The GPU is responsible for rendering graphics and images on the computer monitor. It is especially important for tasks such as gaming and video editing.</p>

        <h2>Basic Troubleshooting Techniques</h2>
        <p>Encountering problems with your computer can be frustrating, but knowing some basic troubleshooting techniques can help you resolve issues quickly. Here are some common techniques:</p>
        <h3>1. Restart Your Computer</h3>
        <p>Many problems can be resolved simply by restarting your computer. This can help clear temporary glitches and reset the system.</p>
        <h3>2. Check Cables and Connections</h3>
        <p>Loose or faulty cables can cause various issues, such as display problems or connectivity issues. Make sure all cables are securely connected.</p>
        <h3>3. Run Antivirus Software</h3>
        <p>If your computer is behaving strangely or showing signs of malware infection, run a full antivirus scan to detect and remove any malicious software.</p>
        <h3>4. Update Drivers</h3>
        <p>Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause hardware malfunctions or performance issues. Make sure to regularly update your drivers to ensure optimal performance.</p>
        <h3>5. Check for Software Updates</h3>
        <p>Software updates often include bug fixes and security patches that can address common issues. Make sure to keep your operating system and applications up to date.</p>
        <h3>6. Consult Online Resources</h3>
        <p>If you're unable to resolve an issue on your own, don't hesitate to seek help from online forums, support websites, or user communities. You may find solutions provided by other users who have encountered similar problems.</p>
   <h3>7. Free Up Disk Space</h3>
    <p>If your computer is running slow or displaying error messages related to low disk space, try freeing up space on your hard drive by deleting unnecessary files or programs.</p>
    
    <h3>8. Run Disk Cleanup and Defragmentation</h3>
    <p>Disk Cleanup and Defragmentation tools can help optimize your hard drive by removing temporary files and organizing data more efficiently. Run these utilities regularly to improve system performance.</p>
    
    <h3>9. Check for Overheating</h3>
    <p>Overheating can cause your computer to slow down or shut down unexpectedly. Make sure your computer's vents are clear of dust and debris, and consider using a cooling pad or adjusting your computer's power settings to prevent overheating.</p>
    
    <h3>10. Perform System Restore</h3>
    <p>If your computer is experiencing issues after installing new software or updates, you can use System Restore to revert your system back to a previous state when it was functioning correctly.</p>
    
    <h3>11. Seek Professional Help</h3>
    <p>If you're unable to resolve an issue on your own, don't hesitate to seek help from a professional technician or computer repair service. They have the expertise and tools necessary to diagnose and fix complex problems.</p>

        <h2>Simple Solutions to Common Problems</h2>
        <p>Most of the time, problems can be fixed using simple troubleshooting techniques, like closing and reopening the program. It's important to try these simple solutions before resorting to more extreme measures. If the problem still isn't fixed, you can try other troubleshooting techniques.
      <br> <h3> Problem: Power button will not start computer </h3>

<ul>
                <li>Solution 1: If your computer does not start, begin by checking the power cord to confirm that it is plugged securely into the back of the computer case and the power outlet.</li>
             <br>   <li>Solution 2: If it is plugged into an outlet, make sure it is a working outlet. To check your outlet, you can plug in another electrical device, such as a lamp.</li>
               <br>  <li>Solution 3: If the computer is plugged in to a surge protector, verify that it is turned on. You may have to reset the surge protector by turning it off and then back on. You can also plug a lamp or other device into the surge protector to verify that it's working correctly.
</li> <br>

              <br>     <li>Solution 4: If you are using a laptop, the battery may not be charged. Plug the AC adapter into the wall, then try to turn on the laptop. If it still doesn't start up, you may need to wait a few minutes and try again.</li>
             </ul> <br>


<h3>Problem: An application is running slowly</h3> <br>
<ul>
<li> Solution 1: Close and reopen the application. </li> <br>
